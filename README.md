# PSoC 6 MCU Watchdog Timer


This example explains how to set up a Watchdog Timer (WDT) using the [WDT](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/mtb-hal-cat1/html/group__group__hal__wdt.html) HAL resource. The WDT resets the device if it is not serviced or "kicked" within the configured timeout interval. This helps in recovering the program from an unintended lock up.

By default, the WDT is reset at least once within each timeout interval to avoid a device reset. The user LED toggles every 1 s in the main loop to indicate that the CPU is in action. In addition, the user LED blinks once for power cycling or an external reset event.

Enable an infinite loop in the `main()` function to block the execution. The device resets in ~4 s. The user LED blinks twice after the device comes out of reset.

## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup
See the [Operation](#operation) section for information on how to modify the code for each event.

## Using the Code Example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. Enter the local path in the **Application(s) Root Path** field to indicate where the application needs to be created.

   Applications that can share libraries can be placed in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In Command-line Interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps:

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In Third-party IDEs</b></summary>

1. Follow the instructions from the **In Command-line Interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

</details>

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Enable the blocking function ( to demonstrate WDT reset ) by updating the macro `ENABLE_BLOCKING_FUNCTION` in the main.c as shown below:
    ```
        #define ENABLE_BLOCKING_FUNCTION             1      
    ```

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
      </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
</details>

4. Observe the status of the LEDs based on different events summarized as follows:

| Project Setting | LED Status |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| With the blocking function | After approximately 4 s, the device resets and the user LED blinks twice within a second to indicate a WDT reset. |
| Without the blocking function| User LED toggles every 1 s to indicate that the CPU is in action. |

Note that the user LED blinks once on a power cycle or an external reset event.

## Design and Implementation

### Resources and Settings

**Table 1. Application Resources**

| Resource  |  Alias/Object     |    Purpose     |
| :------- | :------------    | :------------ |
| WDT (HAL) | wdt_obj          | WDT driver to configure the hardware resource |
| GPIO (HAL)    | CYBSP_USER_LED         | User LED                  |

The WDT in PSoC 6 MCU is a 16-bit timer and uses the Internal Low-Speed Oscillator (ILO) clock of 32 kHz. The WDT is configured using HAL APIs. These APIs configure the ignore bits and the match count for the desired period. The total timeout period of the WDT consists of three match events. To avoid a WDT reset, firmware must clear the WDT before the third match event.

**Notes:**

The interrupt should never be enabled and the WDT match event should always be cleared in the main loop. If interrupt is enabled, upon an interrupt, it needs to be cleared to avoid repeated execution of the WDT interrupt handler. This removes the actual purpose of the WDT.

The `WDT_TIME_OUT_MS` macro specifies the timeout for the reset event in milliseconds. The default value is `4000`. Change this value to get a different time out. The maximum timeout that can be set is given by `CYHAL_WDT_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS`.

To simulate a malfunction, the main loop contains a blocking function (infinite `while` loop). Enabling this blocking function causes WDT match events not to be cleared. After three match events, the device resets. The firmware blinks the user LED twice when the device comes out of reset.
